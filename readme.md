The core screamed out. The display in front of Anna flashed one thousand alerts and appeares to be made of red light so many systems are critical. A neutral voice reads out,


	“63 new messages”

	“200 alerts” 

	“System 63, unresponsive.” 

Anna is still. The shock was all consuming. Everything feels far off and underwater. Seconds ago she was asleep, floating in zero g in a peace deeper than anything she had ever felt on any planet. A feeling of immobility grips her and she gazes outward, eyes unfocused. She wants to move but her body was not allowing it yet. Stars flicker in a static haze as the space shimmers, shifting silently around them. Awakening from a dream into a nightmare, suddenly her mind shifts. She feels her awareness tighten, her visual inlay notices her neurotransmitters signal a shift in consciousness and she rapidly became viscerally aware of her surroundings. Instinct takes hold. She reaches over and grabs a small silver wire and slipped it into her temple input. 

She merges with the ship. Her body, feeling what the ship feels, screams out pain. Something had grabbed her leg and was not letting go. Looking down, she sees a tangle of black vines around her foot. She tries to kick free. The ship weapons fire an energy blast. The black mass responds and slowly slides onto her angle. It was as if something in space had grown tentacles and had reached out in the night. Nothing survives a pulse like that. What was this? 

One thing is certain, the ship is not going to stop moving space or she would already be dead. She has a choice. Continue fighting or disengage and begin a damage report. 

I begin to assess the situation. My hip was definitely dislocated but my leg was still attached. my back experiences something something a shade beyond pain. My vertebrae are completely out of alignment. The bones of my spine are twisted adjusting for the weight that has pulled my hip out of place. Why was the core failing? I feel like I’ve been punched in the stomach. A weakness flows from my centre through my leg and into that black tangle of a leach on my foot. 

I reach up and pull out my neural in and once again I’m whole. I slap the gray panel and slowly began to shift down to the floor as gravity engages. I see my uniform and just don’t care. For now, my standard issue black shorts and tank will need to do. They can handle the ship commander in pyjamas if it means they get to survive. I emerge from my room and Nina has somehow beat me out into the hall in full uniform.  

“Anna, what’s happening? I have distress signals coming in from every engineering sensor onboard.” 

“Honestly? I have no idea. But something appears to have grabbed onto us. It’s leaching energy and I’m not sure what it is. We need to get biotech on it.” 

 “Biotech? Anna are you saying there’s a living thing outside? In dead space? That’s impossible. Nothing could possibly survive out there.” 

 “But something has. All I can tell you is that the ship feels it moving. It’s not mechanical. It feels like some kind of slime leech. Worst yet, it’s draining power from the core. It’s possible that something managed to hitch a ride with us from the Archimedes system. We came in close enough contact with Lemmas during the terraforming initiation that it could be possible. Maybe something was alive in the upper atmosphere and latched on right as we phase shifted. Either way we are going to need Jane. It is nothing that’s ever been accounted for in the data base or Eliza would of known. I would have recognised it.”
